# Enti? Project Proposal

## 📈 Executive Summary

**Project Name**: Enti? (pronounced "enti" with a question mark)

**Vision**: To create a social media platform that prioritizes knowledge discovery over social connection, allowing users to curate content based on their interests while maintaining algorithmic transparency and user control. Unlike traditional social platforms that focus on friends' lives and viral content, Enti? focuses on "things to know about" - the current, past, and future happenings of topics that truly matter to individuals.

**Key Differentiator**: Interest-centric content discovery with AI-powered exploration ("Try New" feature), natural language configuration for content inclusion/exclusion, and adaptive multi-modal interfaces. The platform explicitly avoids misinformation while refusing editorial censorship.

**Target Users**: Knowledge seekers who want deep dives into topics without the noise of social drama, trending hysterics, or algorithmically pushed viral content.

**Business Opportunity**: Position in the growing "declining social media engagement" trend by offering an alternative that emphasizes learning over scrolling.

## 🤔 Problem Statement

### Current Social Media Landscape Issues:

1. **Friend-Centric Focus**: Platforms prioritize friends/family content over meaningful knowledge (e.g., vacation photos instead of research updates)
2. **Algorithmic Dystopia**: Users feel overwhelmed by unfollowable content streams that prioritize virality over value
3. **Misinformation Epidemic**: Echo chambers and paid amplification create trust erosion
4. **One-Interface-Fits-All**: Text-heavy feeds don't work for morning commutes or late-night reading preferences
5. **Negative/Propaganda Content**: Malicious actors and government-funded entities use platforms for influence operations

### User Pain Points:

- "I want to learn about programming language origins, not see my friend's dinner photos"
- "I'm tired of politics and negativity showing up when I just want to stay informed about my interests"
- "Why do I have to choose between Reddit's chaos and TikTok's dopamine hits?"

## 💡 Solution Overview - "Enti?"

Enti? is a content discovery platform where users select interests and see only relevant content, sourced from diverse media types (posts, blogs, podcasts, videos). The platform uses AI to power a "Try New" feature that introduces related topics, configured with natural language rules for inclusion/exclusion.

### Core Innovation: The Model

The defining feature is flexible configuration using human language expressions. Instead of checkboxes, users describe what they want:

**Inclusion Examples**:
- "I want to learn about how programming languages I'm interested in were created, who invented them, and why"
- "Show me how these languages are deployed on hardware and how that hardware communicates"
- "Explain why software is necessary for business problems, like running a rice mill"

**Exclusion Examples**:
- "Don't show me news captured by news channels or government-funded entities that aim to control behavior"
- "Avoid negative content about people backstabbing each other"

---

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. Interest Selection & Curation
- **Multi-topic Selection**: Users pick interests (e.g., "Programming", "Physics", "History", "Sports")
- **Content Types**: Reddit-style posts, Instagram reels, podcast shorts on relevant topics
- **Everlasting Feed**: No algorithmic timeline manipulation - content flows based on user interests purely

### 2. "Try New" Exploration Model
- **AI-Driven Discovery**: Periodically suggests related topics to combat "missing out" anxiety
- **Natural Language Configuration**: Describe exploration patterns in plain English
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Can be enabled/disabled with customizable aggression levels

### 3. Content Filtering & Trust
- **Inclusion/Exclusion Rules**: Natural language filters for content preferences
- **Reliability Scoring**: Transparent signals without censorship (source diversity, fact-checking integration)
- **No Gatekeeping Philosophy**: Platform doesn't editorialize; users decide trust

### 4. Adaptive Interface Modes
- **Multi-Modal Content**: Text posts/blogs, audio (short podcasts), video (reels/shorts)
- **Time-Based Configuration**:
  - Morning: Audio mode (listen while commuting)
  - Evening: Video mode (visual content)
  - Night: Text mode (reading before bed)
- **Override Options**: Manual override for immediate switches

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Data Layer
- **Content Sourcing**: Aggregator from diverse sources (blogs, podcasts, social platforms, academic publications)
- **Reliability Pipeline**: Multi-signal scoring (source reputation, fact-checking APIs, user voting)
- **Anti-Misinformation Focus**: Prioritize precision in what's shown; avoid "too much information" that could be misinterpreted

### Application Layer
- **AI Curation Engine**: NLP model for interpreting natural language rules
- **Personalization Core**: Match user interests with content metadata
- **Exploration Algorithm**: Suggest related topics using semantic similarity and user history

### Presentation Layer
- **Adaptive UI**: Auto-switch between text/voice/video based on time preferences
- **Cross-Platform**: Mobile-first responsive design with web/desktop versions
- **Accessibility**: Support for visual/auditory impairments across all content types

---

## 🧠 The Model (Highlight Feature)

The configuration system uses natural language processing to understand complex user intentions.

### Advanced Configuration Examples:

**Learning Configurations**:
```
"I want to follow how my interests evolve - for programming languages, show me who invented them, the historical context, and why they were created"
:Label: historical-context
```

**Business Connections**:
```
"When exploring programming topics, connect it to real business problems - like how code helps run manufacturing plants or manage supply chains"
:Label: business-applications
```

**Exclusions**:
```
"Never show me political content that seems designed to make people act in certain ways - from any governmental or corporate-funded sources"
:Label: propaganda-exclusion
```

**Negative Content Filters**:
```
"Don't show content that focuses on interpersonal drama, backstabbing, or negative character assassination. I want positive knowledge, not human drama"
:Label: positivity-filter
```

### Model Capabilities:
- Interprets complex causal relationships ("how code enables rice mill operations")
- Handles temporal preferences ("past/future happenings")
- Supports set operations ("include X, exclude Y")

## 🔍 Data Sourcing & Trust Philosophy

### Sourcing Strategy:
- **Decentralized Aggregation**: Pull from multiple platforms (Reddit posts, YouTube channels, podcasts, academic journals)
- **Anti-Censorship Approach**: No editorial control or content removal
- **Vendor Neutrality**: Avoid becoming the "thing" users are trying to escape

### Trust Architecture:
- **Transparency First**: Always show content source, reliability scores, and user feedback
- **ML-Based Reliability**: Use ensemble methods for truthfulness scoring
- **User-Contributed Validation**: Allow communities to mark content quality without platform interference
      
### Misinformation Mitigation:
```
Precision > Recall
When in doubt, show less rather than potentially deceptive content
Focus on verified sources for factual claims
```

## 🛒 Future Roadmap (Phase 2: Shopping Integration)

### Core Concept:
Instead of buying ads, integrate contextual shopping suggestions directly in content.

### Implementation:
1. **Content-Triggered Suggestions**: When viewing content about "best pillows", show product options with editorial reviews
2. **High-Precision Q&A**: Before purchase, enable specific questions:
   - "What do people say about this pillow's support?"
   - "Does it hold head weight or compress too much?"
   - Accuracy priority: We'd rather miss some options than recommend poorly

### Business Model:
- Commission-based affiliate revenue
- No platform-controlled reviews - real user feedback only
- Optional feature - users can disable shopping entirely
